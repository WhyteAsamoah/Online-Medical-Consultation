The Online Medical :stethoscope: Consultation and Subscription is a web-based system that links patients with 
available physicians for online consultations, as well as allowing doctors to prescribe 
medications or provide health advice to patients in session :desktop_computer:. This system is intended for 
doctors/physician assistants/nurse practitioners and patients. A patient may use the system to 
request a chat or consultation with a doctor. The doctor will view and accept the patient's request. 
After that, they'll be able to start consulting.
